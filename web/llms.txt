# AI Content Scanner

> A free, open-source Chrome extension that detects AI-generated images, videos, and text on any webpage.

## What it does

AI Content Scanner scans webpages and flags AI-generated content by analyzing metadata fingerprints, provenance standards, and heuristic patterns. It shows confidence scores, identifies the AI source tool, and surfaces full metadata details.

## Detection methods

### Images & Video
- C2PA / JUMBF: Cryptographic provenance metadata embedded in file binary
- EXIF / XMP software tags: Software, CreatorTool, ImageDescription, DocumentID, InstanceID and 17+ XMP fields
- IPTC DigitalSourceType: Checks for trainedAlgorithmicMedia tag
- SynthID markers: Text references to Google's watermark system
- URL pattern matching: Recognizes AI service hostnames (OpenAI CDN, Replicate, fal.ai, Stability AI, Leonardo, RunwayML, Pika, etc.)
- Alt text / captions: Checks for "AI generated" and tool names in alt/title attributes

### Text
- LLM phrase detection: Flags overuse of phrases common in AI output
- Sentence uniformity: Measures coefficient of variation in sentence lengths
- Paragraph uniformity: Same analysis at paragraph level
- Transition word density: Flags unusually high density of connecting words
- Formality analysis: Detects lack of colloquialisms in long-form text

## Key features
- Auto-scans when you click the extension icon
- Confidence scoring: 0-100% for every detection
- Source identification: DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Adobe Firefly, Google Imagen, Runway, Pika, Kling, Sora, Leonardo AI, and 40+ more
- Fingerprint data: C2PA provenance, IPTC tags, SynthID markers
- Full metadata: EXIF, XMP (17+ fields), embedded document/instance IDs
- URL scanning: Paste any image/video URL to check it directly
- Page overlays: Badges on detected content with hover tooltips
- All analysis runs locally in the browser — no data sent to external servers

## Verdict scale
- AI Detected: Hard evidence found (C2PA, EXIF tool name, IPTC tag). Confidence 85-99%.
- Likely AI: Strong circumstantial evidence. Confidence 50-85%.
- Uncertain: Some signals present but inconclusive. Confidence 30-50%.
- Likely Real: No AI signals detected. Confidence below 30%.
- No Metadata: Could not read metadata (CORS blocked, stripped, etc.).

## Confidence calculation
Confidence is calculated by combining independent signal weights: 1 - (1-w1)(1-w2)...(1-wn), capped at 99%.
- C2PA markers: 95%
- IPTC DigitalSourceType: 92%
- EXIF AI signature: 90%
- SynthID detected: 90%
- URL pattern match: 65%
- Alt text mention: 55%
